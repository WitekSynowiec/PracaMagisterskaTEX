abstract = {Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has become one of the major research subjects in medical imaging and diagnostic radiology. In this article, the motivation and philosophy for early development of CAD schemes are presented together with the current status and future potential of CAD in a PACS environment. With CAD, radiologists use the computer output as a “second opinion” and make the final decisions. CAD is a concept established by taking into account equally the roles of physicians and computers, whereas automated computer diagnosis is a concept based on computer algorithms only. With CAD, the performance by computers does not have to be comparable to or better than that by physicians, but needs to be complementary to that by physicians. In fact, a large number of CAD systems have been employed for assisting physicians in the early detection of breast cancers on mammograms. A CAD scheme that makes use of lateral chest images has the potential to improve the overall performance in the detection of lung nodules when combined with another CAD scheme for PA chest images. Because vertebral fractures can be detected reliably by computer on lateral chest radiographs, radiologists’ accuracy in the detection of vertebral fractures would be improved by the use of CAD, and thus early diagnosis of osteoporosis would become possible. In MRA, a CAD system has been developed for assisting radiologists in the detection of intracranial aneurysms. On successive bone scan images, a CAD scheme for detection of interval changes has been developed by use of temporal subtraction images. In the future, many CAD schemes could be assembled as packages and implemented as a part of PACS. For example, the package for chest CAD may include the computerized detection of lung nodules, interstitial opacities, cardiomegaly, vertebral fractures, and interval changes in chest radiographs as well as the computerized classification of benign and malignant nodules and the differential diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases. In order to assist in the differential diagnosis, it would be possible to search for and retrieve images (or lesions) with known pathology, which would be very similar to a new unknown case, from PACS when a reliable and useful method has been developed for quantifying the similarity of a pair of images for visual comparison by radiologists.}

abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) arises in people who have a genetic susceptibility to environmental factors and events, which ultimately trigger the disease. It is thought that peripheral immune cells are mobilized and enter the CNS through the impaired blood–brain barrier in the subarachnoid space, as acute lesions show large numbers of macrophages and CD8+ T cells and, to a lesser extent, CD4+ T cells, B cells and plasma cells. Demyelination is mostly localized to focal lesions in early relapsing–remitting (RR) MS, whereas other areas of white matter appear normal. Over time, T-cell and B-cell infiltration becomes more diffuse and axonal injury more widespread, leading to self-perpetuating atrophy in both white and gray matter. With disease progression, inflammatory processes are predominantly driven by the action of CNS resident microglia cells. In addition, there is evidence that meningeal lymphoid-like structures can form and contribute to late-stage inflammation. In general, however, despite dynamic changes over time in MS pathology, lesions do not appear to differ significantly in the different classic forms of MS already identified. While all treatments approved for MS management target inflammatory components of RRMS, the B-cell-depleting antibody ocrelizumab is the first such treatment approved recently for primary progressive (PP) MS. However, recent pathological and imaging findings have prompted reconsideration of the clinical phenotypes of MS patients proposed by Lublin's 2013 classification, including clinical and MRI signs of activity, and new imaging biomarkers of remyelination are now being investigated for new strategies of MS management.}

abstract={The systematic study of multiple sclerosis (MS) in populations, started in 1929 by Sydney Allison, now consists of over 400 publications dealing with the prevalence of MS throughout the world. However, any attempt to redefine the pattern of geographical differences in MS frequency remains as difficult as ever. The comparison of prevalence studies carried out in different areas and times is made difficult by the variability in surveyed population sizes, age structures, ethnic origins and composition, and the difficult quantification of numerators, especially regarding the recognition of benign and very early cases. Additionally, complete case ascertainment depends on access to medical care, local medical expertise, number of neurologists, accessibility and availability of new diagnostic procedures, the degree of public awareness about MS, and the investigators' zeal and resources. Critical examination of the more recent data on MS prevalence leads to some revisions of previously held concepts, the most interesting of which is the appreciation of the greater influence of genetic factors on disease acquisition. The rarity of MS among Samis, Turkmen, Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Kyrgyzis, native Siberians, North and South Amerindians, Chinese, Japanese, African blacks and New Zealand Maoris, as well as the high risk among Sardinians, Parsis and Palestinians, clearly indicate that the different susceptibilities of distinct racial and ethnic groups are an important determinant of the uneven geographic distribution of the disease. The updated distribution of MS in Europe, showing many exceptions to the previously described north-south gradient, requires more explanation than simply a prevalence-latitude relationship. Prevalence data imply that racial and ethnic differences are important in influencing the worldwide distribution of MS and that its geography must be interpreted in terms of the probable discontinuous distribution of genetic susceptibility alleles, which can however be modified by environment. Because the environmental and genetic determinants of geographic gradients are by no means mutually exclusive, the race versus place controversy is, to some extent, a useless and sterile debate.},

abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With an aging society, the need to automate time-consuming repetitive actions done by medical doctors to maximize their treatment ability is imminent. Automatic biomedical image segmentation algorithms are set to play a key role in the healthcare of the future. Currently performed by radiologists, the time-consuming procedure consists of assigning areas on the image to corresponding anatomical structures. Novel automatic segmentation algorithms proposed in the literature can be divided into atlas-based, methods using statistical shape knowledge and deep learning algorithms. Deep learning algorithms do not require complex preparation of the atlas or a priori knowledge about the segmented shape. However, their performance is dependent on the training dataset size and quality. Employing the U-Net convolutional neural network architecture, the authors aim to overcome the bottleneck of a small-sized dataset with artificial data augmentation, creating new training samples using flipping and elastic deformation procedures. Algorithms’ further increase of efficiency was obtained by combining binary segmentation models – each model was trained to segment one anatomical structure on the image. As most of the work in the field focuses on the introducing novel neural networks’ architectures to the field, the thorough description of the impact of these refinement steps sets the paper apart from the other publications in the field. The evaluation of the method utilized Dice’s coefficient as a quantitative metric. The presented results show the differences between the model’s coefficient values acquired on different magnetic resonance sequences used in the training process. Furthermore, data augmentation impact on segmentation accuracy is showcased, as well as segmentation examples for visual inspection. The authors discuss also the practical usefulness of the algorithm, its limitations as well as future development plans.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

abstract={In recent years, number of classification techniques for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been developed that produced methods based on the use of hand-crafted machine learning and obscure deep learning models. This study proposed a new classification framework based on the combination of Unet-like 2D convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multinomial logistic regression classifier, which learns the intra-slice for multi-class classification after the selection of the 3D positron emission tomography (PET) image into a sequence of 2D slices. The CNNs are performed to generate the attention features of the brain while the logistic regression incorporated to learn those specifically localized features of various classes for AD classification. At the end of the network, we used a average pooling layer before the softmax for four-class classification problem. It can efficiently generate a flexible class of transformations and that can be trained end-to-end by back propagation. The results indicated that the proposed multi-instance learning (MIL) learns region of interest (ROI) itself and thus that could help to efficiently identify the precise patterns for AD. The proposed combined Unet-like CNN with multinomial regression classifier approach achieved highest accuracy of 97.9{\%} and 96.7{\%} on the classification of AD and MCI, respectively. It is much higher than the performances of the conventional methods in the literature.},

abstract={Brain tumor image segmentation is a challenging problem in medical image processing. The purpose is to obtain tumor location, size, structure and other information through intelligent processing of medical image data. Accurate brain tumor segmentation algorithm plays an important role in the early diagnosis and treatment planning of tumors. Therefore, this paper proposes a brain tumor segmentation algorithm based on M-Unet network(Multi-scale Unet). This method adds multi-scale convolution modules to the feature fusion part of the original Unet network, so that the network can better extract the multiscale features of the image. At the same time, the cosine annealing learning rate attenuation strategy is used in the training process, so that the network can jump out of the local optimal solution to obtain the best network weight. The results show that the M - Unet network achieves high segment results in MRI image dataset, and the Jaccard coefficient and Dice coefficient of the algorithm reach 0.783 and 0.873 respectively; Compared with the original Unet network, the Jaccard coefficient and Dice coefficient are increased by 2.5{\%} and 4.3{\%} respectively, which shows that M-Unet network can effectively improve the segmentation performance of brain tumor image.},

               activities of daily living. The prevalence of cognitive

abstract={The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) is based on demonstrating evidence of inflammatory-demyelinating injury within the central nervous system that is disseminated in both time and space. Diagnosis is made through a combination of the clinical history, neurologic examination, magnetic resonance imaging and the exclusion of other diagnostic possibilities. Other so-called ``paraclinical'' tests, including the examination of the cerebrospinal fluid, the recording of evoked potentials, urodynamic studies of bladder function, and ocular coherence tomography, may be helpful in establishing the diagnosis for individual patients, but are often unnecessary. Differential diagnosis in MS must be guided by clinical presentation and neurologic localization. While the list of conditions that can mimic MS clinically or radiologically is long, in clinical practice there are few conditions that truly mimic MS on both fronts. A positive test for a putative MS ``mimic'' does not unto itself exclude the diagnosis of MS. Typical symptoms of MS include discrete episodes (``attacks'' or ``relapses'') of numbness, tingling, weakness, vision loss, gait impairment, incoordination, imbalance, and bladder dysfunction. In between attacks, patients tend to be stable, but may experience fatigue and heat sensitivity. Some MS patients go on to experience, or only experience, an insidious worsening of neurologic function and accumulation of disability (``progression'') that is not associated with discrete relapse activity. Progression accounts for most of the long-term disability in MS. Diagnostic criteria for MS have evolved over the past several decades, with each revision impacting the apparent prevalence and prognosis of the disorder -- the result has been to encourage earlier diagnosis without compromising accuracy.},

abstract={Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most famous autoimmune disease attacking the central nervous system. It attacks people from age 20--50 years old and the females' attacks double than males' attacks. MS is an autoimmune disease affecting principally the central nervous system that cause nerve sheath demyelination followed by axon damage and paralysis. MS symptoms include muscle weakness, weak reflexes, muscle spasm, difficult in move, miss-coordination and unbalance with others. There are many factors may be responsible for MS: microbial, viral, smoking, stress, environmental toxins, contaminated diet, and gout. MS is wide spread in the populations in North Europe and this related to lack of vitamin D due to decrease of sunlight exposure. MS biomarkers include nitric oxide, interleukin-6, nitric oxide synthase, fetuin-A and osteopontin. MS is not a genetic disease where MS occurs when human leukocyte antigen system related genes are changed in chromosome 6. The physiology of MS is monitored by activation of immune-inflammatory, oxidative, and nitrosative stress pathways. MS is including two main steps: (1) myelin sheath destruction and formation of lesions and, (2) inflammation. Four types of MS can be distinguished: relapsing-remitting, primary progressive, secondary progressive and progressive relapsing. Nine treatments have been accepted for relapsing-remitting MS type: interferon $\beta$-1a, interferon $\beta$-1b, mitoxantrone, natalizumab, glatiramer acetate, fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, and alemtuzumab, however, the only treatment used is mitoxantrone for progressive MS but many of MS treatments side effects are recorded. Complementary treatments also used in MS treatments such as: vitamin D, Yoga, medicinal plants, oxygen therapy, acupuncture and reflexology.},

pages={3009-3018},
abstract={There have been considerable debates over 2D and 3D representation learning on 3D medical images. 2D approaches could benefit from large-scale 2D pretraining, whereas they are generally weak in capturing large 3D contexts. 3D approaches are natively strong in 3D contexts, however few publicly available 3D medical dataset is large and diverse enough for universal 3D pretraining. Even for hybrid (2D + 3D) approaches, the intrinsic disadvantages within the 2D/3D parts still exist. In this study, we bridge the gap between 2D and 3D convolutions by reinventing the 2D convolutions. We propose ACS (axial-coronal-sagittal) convolutions to perform natively 3D representation learning, while utilizing the pretrained weights on 2D datasets. In ACS convolutions, 2D convolution kernels are split by channel into three parts, and convoluted separately on the three views (axial, coronal and sagittal) of 3D representations. Theoretically, ANY 2D CNN (ResNet, DenseNet, or DeepLab) is able to be converted into a 3D ACS CNN, with pretrained weight of a same parameter size. Extensive experiments validate the consistent superiority of the pretrained ACS CNNs, over the 2D/3D CNN counterparts with/without pretraining. Even without pretraining, the ACS convolution can be used as a plug-and-play replacement of standard 3D convolution, with smaller model size and less computation.},

  abstract = "Whether you deal with a real-life issue or create a software
              product, optimization is constantly the ultimate goal. This goal,
              however, is achieved by utilizing one of the optimization
              algorithms. The progressively popular Gradient Descent (GD)
              optimization algorithms are frequently used as black box
              optimizers when solving unrestricted problems of optimization.
              Each iteration of a gradient-based algorithm attempts to approach
              the minimizer/maximizer cost function by using the gradient's
              objective function information. Moreover, a comparative study of
              various GD variants like Gradient Descent (GD), Batch Gradient
              Descent (BGD), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Mini-batch
              GD are described in this paper. Additionally, this paper outlines
              the challenges of those algorithms and presents the most widely

abstract={We analyze the performance of multi-dimensional gated recurrent units on automated lesion segmentation in multiple sclerosis. The segmentation of these pathologic structures is not trivial, since location, shape and size can be arbitrary. Furthermore, the inherent class imbalance of about 1 lesion voxel to 10 000 healthy voxels further exacerbates the correct segmentation. We introduce a new MD-GRU setup, using established techniques from the deep learning community as well as our own adaptations. We evaluate these modifications by comparing them to a standard MD-GRU network. We demonstrate that using data augmentation, selective sampling, residual learning and/or DropConnect on the RNN state can produce better segmentation results. Reaching rank {\#}1 in the ISBI 2015 longitudinal multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation challenge, we show that a setup which combines these techniques can outperform the state of the art in automated lesion segmentation.},

               are not beneficial for patients in terms of cost, time, and
               usability. The authors of the present paper propose a method
               employing just one modality (FLAIR image) to segment MS lesions
               accurately. Methods: A patch-based Convolutional Neural Network
               (CNN) is designed, inspired by 3D-ResNet and spatial-channel
               attention module, to segment MS lesions. The proposed method
               consists of three stages: (1) the Contrast-Limited Adaptive
               Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) is applied to the original images
               and concatenated to the extracted edges to create 4D images; (2)
               the patches of size [Formula: see text] are randomly selected
               from the 4D images; and (3) the extracted patches are passed
               into an attention-based CNN which is used to segment the
               lesions. Finally, the proposed method was compared to previous
               studies of the same dataset. Results: The current study
               evaluates the model with a test set of ISIB challenge data.
               Experimental results illustrate that the proposed approach
               significantly surpasses existing methods of Dice similarity and
               Absolute Volume Difference while the proposed method uses just
               one modality (FLAIR) to segment the lesions. Conclusion: The
               authors have introduced an automated approach to segment the
               lesions, which is based on, at most, two modalities as an input.
               The proposed architecture comprises convolution, deconvolution,
               and an SCA-VoxRes module as an attention module. The results
               show, that the proposed method outperforms well compared to
               other methods.",

abstract={Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation from MR images is important for neuroimaging analysis. MS is diffuse, multifocal, and tend to involve peripheral brain structures such as the white matter, corpus callosum, and brainstem. Recently, U-Net has made great achievements in medical image segmentation area. However, the insufficiently use of context information and feature representation, makes it fail to achieve segmentation of MS lesions accurately. To solve the problem, 3D attention context U-Net (ACU-Net) is proposed for MS lesion segmentation in this paper. The proposed ACU-Net includes 3D spatial attention block, which is used to enrich spatial details and feature representation of lesion in the decoding stage. Furthermore, in the encoding and decoding stage of the network, 3D context guided module is designed for guiding local information and surrounding information. The proposed ACU-Net was evaluated on the ISBI 2015 longitudinal MS lesion segmentation challenge dataset, and it achieved superior performance compared to latest approaches.},

abstract={Fully convolutional deep neural networks have been asserted to be fast and precise frameworks with great potential in image segmentation. One of the major challenges in training such networks raises when the data are unbalanced, which is common in many medical imaging applications, such as lesion segmentation, where lesion class voxels are often much lower in numbers than non-lesion voxels. A trained network with unbalanced data may make predictions with high precision and low recall, being severely biased toward the non-lesion class which is particularly undesired in most medical applications where false negatives are actually more important than false positives. Various methods have been proposed to address this problem, including two-step training, sample re-weighting, balanced sampling, and more recently, similarity loss functions and focal loss. In this paper, we fully trained convolutional deep neural networks using an asymmetric similarity loss function to mitigate the issue of data imbalance and achieve much better tradeoff between precision and recall. To this end, we developed a 3D fully convolutional densely connected network (FC-DenseNet) with large overlapping image patches as input and an asymmetric similarity loss layer based on Tversky index (using  {\$}F{\_}{\backslash}beta {\$}  scores). We used large overlapping image patches as inputs for intrinsic and extrinsic data augmentation, a patch selection algorithm, and a patch prediction fusion strategy using B-spline weighted soft voting to account for the uncertainty of prediction in patch borders. We applied this method to multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation based on two different datasets of MSSEG 2016 and ISBI longitudinal MS lesion segmentation challenge, where we achieved average Dice similarity coefficients of 69.9{\%} and 65.74{\%}, respectively, achieving top performance in both the challenges. We compared the performance of our network trained with  {\$}F{\_}{\backslash}beta {\$}  loss, focal loss, and generalized Dice loss functions. Through September 2018, our network trained with focal loss ranked first according to the ISBI challenge overall score and resulted in the lowest reported lesion false positive rate among all submitted methods. Our network trained with the asymmetric similarity loss led to the lowest surface distance and the best lesion true positive rate that is arguably the most important performance metric in a clinical decision support system for lesion detection. The asymmetric similarity loss function based on  {\$}F{\_}{\backslash}beta {\$}  scores allows training networks that make a better balance between precision and recall in highly unbalanced image segmentation. We achieved superior performance in MS lesion segmentation using a patch-wise 3D FC-DenseNet with a patch prediction fusion strategy, trained with asymmetric similarity loss functions.},
