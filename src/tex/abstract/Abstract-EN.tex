Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the most common neurodegenerative illnesses, often resulting in disabilities. It may procure serious harm to vision, balance, muscle control, and also is negatively influencing daily activities and mental health. One of the diagnosis and disease-control method is observation of lesions on MRI scans. Lesion segmentation is a time costly process, it requires a lot of human resources, the result of it may be biased by human views. The tool is proposed, that would be able to automatically perform the lesion segmentation task. For this reason, the convolutional neural network is used, that would handle the task. Great many of publications have been made, often with unsuccessful results. The hardship in training neural networks to perform a lesion segmentation is heavy imbalance of data. In the following solution, the use of a weighted cost function is proposed. Prepared networks do have good results with MS lesion segmentation. The data gathered from ISBI and OFSEP has been used, that contain MRI scans and lesion segmentation ground-truths.
